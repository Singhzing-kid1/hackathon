**What is the Calgary Youth Hackathon?**
The Calgary Youth Hackathon focuses on introducing coding basics and essentials to youth interested in computers. In contrast to a usual hackathon, the CYH will be a design and creation competition paired with an intuitive and easy going course on coding essentials in Python. The course aims to let participants have a hands-on approach to programming. 

Projects don't have to be super complicated! Simple projects are perfectly fine as long as they address mental health.


# Idea:

An app that gives a mental health check to see how you are feeling. It also inculdes a section for journaling your feelings. There will also be a self-harm absteince section that will ask you if you have harmed yourself, and will give you points that you can use to redeem something.
