# Hackathon

## Hackathon info:

**What is the Calgary Youth Hackathon?**
The Calgary Youth Hackathon focuses on introducing coding basics and essentials to youth interested in computers. In contrast to a usual hackathon, the CYH will be a design and creation competition paired with an intuitive and easy going course on coding essentials in Python. The course aims to let participants have a hands-on approach to programming.

Projects don't have to be super complicated! Simple projects are perfectly fine as long as they address mental health.


## Idea:

An app that gives a mental health check to see how you are feeling. It also includes a section for journaling your feelings. There will also be a self-harm abstinence section that will ask you if you have harmed yourself, and will give you points that you can use to redeem something. If you are just feeling sad, it might give you a breathing exercise. But if you have been feeling sad, say for the past couple of weeks, it would give you a suggestion to connect with other people who are feeling the same way you are. If you report that you are feeling suicidal the app will return the phone numbers for helplines in your area. You also have access to a connect tab, where you can connect with people who are feeling the same as you are in your area.
